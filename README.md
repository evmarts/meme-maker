# meme-maker
Takes text and an image and creates a meme.

### Motivation:

Memes found on Instagram typically look like the following:

<img src="./docs/twitter_screencap_meme.jpg" width="256px" alt="">

Usually these memes are created by tweeting the text accompanied by the image to Twitter and then cropping the screencap of the post. 

This is an unnecessary amount of work for a simple task, especially if one is creating these memes in batches.
